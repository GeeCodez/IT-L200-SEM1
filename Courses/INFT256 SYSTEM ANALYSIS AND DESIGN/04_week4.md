# Rapid Application Development
* Used to build high quality products at a fast rate
* Requirments gathering
* Prototyping and early iterative testing
* Reuse of software 
* Referal of improvements to the next product version

## STAGES OF THE RAD
* **Business modelling**: generating an overview of everything that goes on in the business.
* **Data Model**: data is transformed into entities. e.g customers, orders
* **Process Modelling**: processing descriptions are created on how data will be processed and how the flow will be.
* **Application generation**
* **Testing and turnover**

### WHEN TO USE RAD MODEL?
1. When time span is short
2. When requirements are well known
3. When technical riks is limited
4. To be used only if budget allows code generation


# PROJECT PLANNING
**Software project planning**: is the complete process of building and maintaining a working software within a specific period of time.
* Requirements gathering, testing, deployment.

## WHY DO WE NEED PROJECT MANAGEMENT ?
* Most software products are custom made to meet customer needs.
* There is high risk involved in building software hence the need for management
* Technology changes rapidly that one experience cannot always be used.

### PROJECT MANAGERS
* Responsible for planning and scheduling project development
* Ensure the final work is of required standard.
* Monitor progress to ensure timely delivery.
* Ensure that development goes on according to planned budget.

To plan a successful project, we must understand:
* Scope of the work to be completed
* Risk analysis
* Resources that are needed.
* The project to be accomplished.

**Project planning involves**: 
* Size estimation: essential for estimating other activities
* Cost estimation 
* Development time estimation
* Resources requirment: based on cost and dev't time
* Project scheduling: for controlling and monitoring project

**Risks**: an issue that has the potential to cause harm to the project in the future but has not happened yet.
**Risk management**: is the system of identifying addressing and eliminating potential issues before they can damage the project.
