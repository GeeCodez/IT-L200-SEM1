# SYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS LIFE CYCLE 

![SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE](/images/system_dev_cycle.png)

* **The system development lifecycle (SDLC)** is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality systems.
*It has 4 main stages: planning, analysis, design and implementation.


### PLANNING
* **Project Initiation**: defining system requirements and feasibility planning
* **Project management**: develop a work plan, staff project, control and direct project.
* *Answers: why should we bulid the system*

#### ANALYSIS
* develop analysis strategy, gather requirements and develop system proposal
* *Answers: what should the system do for us? Where and when the system will be used ?*

#### DESIGN
* develop a design strategy, design architecture and interfaces, develo databases and file specs.
* Develop the program design.
* ***Answers**: How will we build the system?*

#### IMPLEMENTATION
* Construct the system, install the system, implement a training plan for users and 
*Establish a support plan
* *build the system*

### PUTTING IT TOGETHER 
* Each stage has deliverables
* It evolves through gradual refinement


#### | PROCESSES | DELIVERABLES |
| 1. Planning | Project Plan |
| 2. Analysis | System Proposal |
| 3. Design   | System specs |
| 4. Implementation | New systems and maintenance plan |


# SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES
* These refer to a formalized approach to implementing the SLDC.
* Examples: V-model, waterfall, parallel dev, rapid app dev, agile dev.

## **CATEGORIES OF METHODOLOGIES**
1. **Structured Design**: Waterfall, Parallel
2. **Rapid Application Dev**: Phased, prototyping,throwaway prototyping
3. **Agile dev**: extreme Programming.

### STRUCTURED DESIGN 
#### Waterfall
* follows a step by step approach
* PLANNING -> ANALYSE -> DESIGN -> IMPLEMENTATION -> SYSTEM
* *After a stage is completed, you can't go back and make ammends*

#### Parallel dev 
* Breaks large project into small, independent project.
* Built simulataneously after analysis phase
* ![Parallel dev](images/parallel.png)


### RAPID APP DEV
#### Phased
* Project broken into logical stages
* Each stage has requirements and deadlines
* ![Phased](images/phased.png)

#### Prototyping
* Mock project of the actual project
* ![Prototyping](prototype.png)

#### Throwaway prototyping

### Agile Dev
* Extreme programming
