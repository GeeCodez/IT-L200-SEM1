# SYSTEM DESIGN AND ANALYSIS

**System** is an organized set of interrelated components that work together according to a defined plan to achieve a common goal.

**System Development** is a systematic process which includes planning, analysis, design, deployment and maintenance of systems.

**System Analysis** is the process of gathering and analyzing information about an existing system, identifying problems, and breaking the system into components to understand how it works and how it can be improved.
* Done to identify the objectives of the system

## System Design 
* Is the process of planning a new system or replacing an existing by redefining its components to meets its requirements
* Focuses on **how to accomplish the objective of the system**.

**SAD** *mainly focuses on Systems Processes and Technology*

### CONSTRAINTS OF SYSTEMS
*Every system has 3 constraints*
#### Structure and behaviour to achieve objectives
* **Structure**: arrangement and relationsip between components.
* **Behavior**: How system operates to perform tasks. eg: data flow, etc.

#### Interconnectivity and Interdependence
* This is essential for efficiency, fucntionality and resilience. 

#### Central objective has high priority than subsystem objectives
* Important for the alignment of goals to the central objective.
* For efficient system optimization
* Unity of purpose


### PROPERTIES OF A SYSTEM
* **Organization:** structure and order. 
* **Interaction**: cooperations
* **Interdependence**
* **Integration** 
* **Central Objective**

### ELEMENTS OF A SYSTEM
![Elements of a system](D:\Users\IT L200 SEM1\Courses\INFT256 SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN\system.png)

* Main aim of a system is to produce output
* Processor transforms input into output
* Control element guides the system. 
* Feedback provides the control in a dynamic system. Positive encourages performance and negative suggests change of actions
* Environmen is the external supersystem in which an organization operates, influencing and contraining system functions.
* System boundaries are the limits that define a system’s scope and its interaction with other systems.

### TYPES OF SYSTEMS
* **Physical systems**(static/dynamic) and **Abstract systems**(conceptual)
* **Open System**(interacts with environment) and **Closed systems**.
* **Adaptive** (responds to environmental changes) and **Non-adaptive**.
* **Permanent** and **Temporal** (only for a specified time).
* **Natural** and **Manufactured**
* **Determistic** (operates in predictable way) and **Probabilistic** (shows uncertain behaviour).
* **Social system** (composes people), **Human-machine** and **Machine Systems** (no human interferences).
