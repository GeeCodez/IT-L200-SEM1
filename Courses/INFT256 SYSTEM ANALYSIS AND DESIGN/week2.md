### TYPES OF SYSTEMS 
* **Abstract and Physical**
* **Adabptive and non-adaptive**: Adaptive sysetms respond to changes in env whiles non-adaptive don't
* **Permanent and temporal**
* **Natural systems**: made by nature and **Manufactured**: made by man
* **Determistic and Probabilistic systems**: 
Deterministic systems operates in a predictable manner and the interaction between systems components is known with certainity
Probabilistic shows no certain pattern

* **Social systems**: made up of humans
* **Human and social systems**
* **Machines**

## SYSTEM DEV LIFE CYCLE 
![SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE](system_dev_cycle.drawio)
**The software development lifecycle (SDLC)** is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality systems.

*It has four stages*
* **Planning**
* **Analysis**
* **Design**
* **Implementation**: building, testing, deployment and maintenance


#### PLANNING
1. **Project Initiation**: defining system requirements and feasibility planning

2. **Project management**: develop a work plan, recruit staff and control and direct the project
*Planning stage answers the question, what are we building, why are we building and who are we building for ?*

#### ANALYSIS
* develop analysis strategy, gather requirements and develop system proposal
*It answers the question: what should the system do for us and where and when the system will be used*

#### DESIGN
*answers the question, how to achieve the objectives of the system*
* develop architecture
* system specs, database specs

#### IMPLEMENTATION
* Construct the system, install the system, implement a training plan for users and establish a support plan
*build the system*

### PUTTING IT TOGETHER 
* Each stage has deliverables
* It evolves through gradual refinement


#### PROCESSES AND THEIR DELIVERABLES
1. Planning -> Project Plan
2. Analysis -> System Proposal
3. Design   -> System specs 
4. Implementation -> New systems and maintenance plan


## SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES
These refer to a formalized approach to implementing the SLDC

**CATEGORIES OF METHODOLOGIES**
1. **Structured design**
* Waterfall dev
* Parallel dev

2. **Rapid app dev**
* Phased
* Prototyping
* Throwaway prototyping

3. 
* Agile ( extreme programming )

### STRUCTURED DESIGN 
1. **waterfall**: follows a step by step approach
PLANNING -> ANALYSE -> DESIGN -> IMPLEMENTATION -> SYSTEM
*After a stage is completed, you can't go back and make ammends*

2. **Parallel dev**: 

Parallel development methodology is a system development approach that breaks a large project into smaller, independent sub-projects, which are designed and implemented simultaneously after an initial, unified analysis phase.

### RAPID APP DEV
1. **Phased dev**: involves breaking a project into logical stages. Each stage can be treated as an individual project with its own objectives, requirements, and timeline

2. **System Prototyping**: developing a mock project of the actual system


### Agile methodology is flexible
