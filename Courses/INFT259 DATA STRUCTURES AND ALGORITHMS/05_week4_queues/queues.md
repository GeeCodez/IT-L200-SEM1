# QUEUES
* A linear data structure that is open at both ends and follows the First In First Out(FIFO) principle. Eg: people queueing to join a bus
* Insertion occurs at the rear and deletion accurs at the front.
* Process of adding an element is **enqueing** and removing an element is **dequeing**
* A queue overflow occurs when u add more elements than the capacity
* Underflow occurs when you try to dequeue an empty queue.
* IsEmpty() checks whether a queue is empty and peak() checks the front element in a queue.

**Use cases of queues**:
* CPU and process scheduling
* Handling requests in printers and servers
* Background job scheduling in applications
