# LINKED LISTS
* Dynamic Linear data structure in which each element is a seperate object known as a node.
* Each node contains some data and a pointer that points to the memory location of the next node.
* Starts with a head and ends with a tail which points to null
* Stores nodes of different data types
* Operations include: insertion, deletion, searching, display, and deleting at a given key.
* Declared in C++ using "struck Node{
    int data;
    Node* next;
} "

### TYPES OF LINKED LISTS
* **Singly**: contains 2 buckets, one pointing to the next node and one holding data
* **Doubly**: points to both the previous and the next node
* **Circular**: last node points to the first node. Can be in both singly and doubly
