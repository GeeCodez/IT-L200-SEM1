`# Data structures and algorithms-Dr. S. O Frimpong

### DURATION: 11 weeks / 3hrs/week





**INTRODUCTION:**



### **DATA**

#### Raw facts that describe a specific entity. eg: description, properties.



**THREE TYPES OF DATA**
##### data types define what kind of values can be stored and what operations can be performed on them

* **Numeric Data eg:** float, integers, double, short, short int
* **Boolean Data (**True, False)
* **String/CharSets- alphanumeric**
* read more ...



**CATEGORIES OF DATA** (get further explanation)
##### Classification of data in terms of processing difficulty

* **Structured Data -** has a fixed format and can be processed directly to provide meaning ( age, date, numeric )
* **Unstructured -** has no fixed format and are hard to process directly (images, video, audio )
* **Semi-structured -** documents, html, json. Has some structure but not easy to manipulate. common in APIs and web systems
* read more ....





### **STRUCTURES**

Frameworks on which we can organize data. 

**Data structures** is the systematic way of **organizing** and storing data that enables **efficient and effective manipulation** of that data


**WAYS TO STRUCTURE DATA**

1. **Linear data structures (5)** data arranged sequentially 

* Arrays 
* Linked-list
* Stacks ( plates stacked on each other )
* Queues ( people in a line )
* List 



**2. Non-linear (3)** data arranged in a hierachical or networked form

* Graphs
* Charts
* Tree



### ALGORITHMS



* Searching algorithms -used to find a specific value (Linear search, binary search)
* Sorting Algorithms - to arrange data in order ( bubble sort, selection sort)

**Structure + algorithm gives meaning to data**
