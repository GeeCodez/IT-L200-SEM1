### Characteristics of a Data Structure
* **Correctness** − implementation should implement its
interface correctly.

* **Time Complexity** − Minimum execution time of operations

* **Space Complexity** − Minimum memoery usage

### Importance of data structures
* Data search
* Processor speed
* Handling multiple requests

### Operations on Data structures
* **Traversal**: accessing each node exactly once so that certain items can be processed. 
* **Searching**: finding nodes
* **Inserting**
* **Deleting**

## ALGORITHM BASICS
Refers to a sequence of computational steps that transform the
input into the output in a finite amount of time.
examples: search, sort, update, delete, insert, search algorithms.


### Complexity and efficiency of algorithms
* **Time Complexity**: time needed to run to completion
* **Space Complexity**: space needed to run to completion

 It is not always possible to get a time efficient and a space efficient algorithm
