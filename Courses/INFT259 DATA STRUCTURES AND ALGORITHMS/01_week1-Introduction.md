**INTRODUCTION:**



### **DATA**
Data is simply a collection of facts and figures about an event or an object. eg: description, properties.
**Data Item** refers to  single unit of value. They can be elementary or group items. 


**DATA TYPES**
**Data types** are classifications of data that specify the type of value a variable can store and the operations that can be performed on it. eg: float, string, etc.
* There are primitive(holds single values, and natural to programming languages, eg floats) and non primitive (holds group of values,derived from primitive, eg: arrays,) data types

* **Examples of data types include:**
* **Numeric Data eg:** float, integers, double, short, short int
* **Boolean Data (**True, False)
* **String/CharSets- alphanumeric**



**CATEGORIES OF DATA**
##### Classifications of data in terms of processing difficulty

* **Structured Data -** has a fixed format and can be processed directly to provide meaning ( excel sheets, database tables)
* **Unstructured -** has no fixed format and are hard to process directly (images, video, audio )
* **Semi-structured -** documents, html, json. Don't have a strict structure but has some organizational structure. common in APIs and web systems



### **STRUCTURES**

**Data structures** is the systematic way of **organizing** and storing large amounts data that enables **efficient and effective manipulation** of that data.


**WAYS TO STRUCTURE DATA**

1. **Linear data structures (5)** data arranged sequentially.
examples: arrays, qeues, lists, stack


**2. Non-linear (3)** data arranged in a hierachical or networked form.
eg: trees


### **ALGORITHMS**

* **Searching algorithms** -used to find a specific value (Linear search, binary search)
* **Sorting Algorithms** - to arrange data in order ( bubble sort, selection sort)

**Structure + algorithm gives meaning to data**

**Interfaces:** define of operations supported by a data structure.
**Implementation:** An implementation is the actual code that defines how the operations of an interface are carried out
