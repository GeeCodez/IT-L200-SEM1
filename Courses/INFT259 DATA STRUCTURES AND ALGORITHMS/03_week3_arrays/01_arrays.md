## Arrays
Static data structure that stores same type of data in contiguous memory location. 

**Declaration:** allocating memory space for an array.

### Characteristics of arrays
1. **Fixed size**: declared at declaration time
2. **Contiguous Memory Allocation**
3. **Random Access of elements** using indexes

CODE IMPLEMENTATION OF
ARRAYS

Declaration of an Array
Int arr[5]; // declaring an array of size 5

Initializing an Array
Int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // declaration
and initialization 


### MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
* Array that contains arrays as its elements
* In 2D arrays, each element is defined by 3 indexes and so on for higher arrays
check [multidimensional.cpp] for code implementation


### APPLICATIONS OF ARRAYS
* Matrix manipulations
* String as an array o f characters is some programming languages
* String manipulation
* Pattern Matching

### LIMITS OF ARRAYS
1. **Fixed size**
2. **Memory waste**: when allocated space is not fully used
3. **Memory overflow**: if more elements exceed allocated size.
