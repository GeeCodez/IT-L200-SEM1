# Data structures and algorithms-Dr. S. O Frimpong

### DURATION: 11 weeks / 3hrs/week





**INTRODUCTION:**



### **DATA**

#### Raw facts and describe a specific entity. eg: description, properties.



**THREE TYPES OF DATA**

* **Numeric Data eg:** float, integers, double, short, short int
* **Boolean Data (**True, False)
* **String/CharSets- alphanumeric**

**CATEGORIES OF DATA** (get further explanation)

* **Structured Data -** can be processed to provide meaning ( age, date, numeric )
* **Unstructured -** cannot be easily processed to provide meaning but can be edited in a specific way  (images)
* **Semi-structured -** documents, html, json. Can be manipulated but not necessarily processed. 
* read more ....





### **STRUCTURES**

Frameworks on which we can organize data. 

**Data structures** deals with **how efficient/effective** we **manipulate and organize** data to make it use.



**WAYS TO STRUCTURE DATA**

1. **Linear data structures (5)**

* Arrays 
* Linked-list
* Stacks
* Queues
* List



**2. Non-linear (3)**

* Graphs
* Charts
* Tree



### ALGORITHMS



* Searching algorithms - methods use to search for a particular data in a group of data
* Sorting Algorithms - methods used to sort data in a list of data
