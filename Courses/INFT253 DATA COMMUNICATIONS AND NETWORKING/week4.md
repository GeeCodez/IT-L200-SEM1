# Ethernet Cable Termination

## LOG BOOK WORK 2
### Main objectives
* To establish a reliable standard compliant and high-performance physical connection between network devices by properly attaching connectors(RJ45) to twisted pair cable., ensuring optimal signal transmission with minimal interference or faults

### Specific objectives
* To terminate a cat6 cable using tools such as Cable cutter, crimping tools and network cable testors.
* Use the T568b color wiring standard in terminating the cat6 cable
* Test the terminated cable using the Network Cable tester

### Why RJ45 Cable
1. Its an 8-bit modular matching cable style.
2. Universally compatible

### Why T568B
1. Universally compatible
2. Industry Standard
3. Optimized design

cat6 cables are also twisted pair cables.

**Color coding for the T568B**
| Pin No | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| Color | Orange white | Orange | White green | Blue | White Blue | Green | White brown | Brown |
Pin1(orange/white) Pin2(orange) Pin3(white/green) Pin4(Blue)
PIn5(white/blue)  Pin6(Green) Pin7(white/brown) Pin8(Brown)

### PROCEDURE
1. Cut the cable coating using the network cable cutter
2. Remove the cable coating
3. Cut and remove the wire-like plastic at the middle of the cables using the crimping tool
4. Untwist the twisted pairs carefully
5. Straigthen the wires while arranging them using the T568b color coding scheme:
    - White orange, orange , White green, blue, White blue, Green, White brown, brown
7. With the copper side of the RJ45 facing you, insert the arranged cables firmly 
    - **NB**: The first cable must be White orange
8. Insert the terminated endpoint into the crimping tool and press until you here a crimp sound
9. Once the wire is terminated,test both ends using a network cable tester.
10. 8 greens mean the cable is working perfectly. If there are any jumped steps, then the cable is not well terminated.
