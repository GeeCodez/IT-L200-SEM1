# THE LANGUAGE OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
* **Computer network**: An interconnection of computers and devices that communicate using wired or wireless media.
* Local, Metropolitan, Wide, Personal area networks.
* **Voice networks**: transmits only telephone signals.
* **Data networks**: transmits both voice and comp. data.
* **Data communications**: transfer of digital/analog data using digital/analog signals.
* **Telecommunications**: transmission of information over long distances using electronic means.
* **Network management**: design, installation, and maintenance of a network, including its hardware and software. 
* **Network cloud**: A network that stores applications, software and data. 
* Networks are composed of workstations, servers, hubs, switches, telephone switching gears, etc.

## COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS LAYOUT
* LAN to WAN
* LAN to LAN
* Micro computer to LAN
* Micro computer to internet
* PAN to workstation
* LAN to MAN
* LAN to WAN: connection is done by a router.
* WAN to WAN
* Sensor to LAN
* Satellite to microwave
* Cell phone layout
* Terminal to mainframe computer layout. 

**Routers**: are used to connect a local area network to Large area Network.
**Switches**: 

## NETWORK ARCHITECTURES

### Reference Models
* They describe the layers of hardware and software necessary to transmit data between two points or for multiple devices/application to interoperate.
* Two reference models: TCP/IP protocol suite and OSI model.

### TCP/IP suite (The internet Model)
* May have 5/4 layers
* **Application layer**: where application using the network resides. Eg: email, browsing
* **Transport Layer**: performs functions neccessary for presenting the data package properly from the sender to the receiver.
* **Network (Internet/IP/Internetwork) layer**: creates and maintains connections. Transfer data from node to node.
* **Network Access(Data Link) layer**: tranforms data into frames with headers, control address information and transmit data between workstation and the network.
* **Physical Layer**: Handles communication of bits over transmission channels.

### Open System Interconnection Model.
* **Application Layer**
* **Presentation layer**: for final presentation (code conversion, compression and encryption)
* **Session Layer**: establishes sessions between users
* **Transport Layer**: equivalent to TCP/IP's tranport Layer
* **Network Layer**: same as TCP/IP network
* **Data Link Layer**
* **Physical Layer**:

### PHYSICAL AND LOGICAL CONNECTIONS
* **Physical connections** exists in software, **Logical connections** exist in hardware.
* Only lowest layers, contains physical connections.
* At each layer of a network, information is either added or removed depending on whether its leaving or arriving at a workstation.
* **Encapsulation**: is the adding of information over a pre-existing information.
